# Valhalla Updater

Valhalla Updater is a versatile tool designed to simplify the process of checking for updates and automatically updating CurseForge and FeedTheBeast modpacks, built with modularity in mind. It was designed to be used on ValhallaMC Network. You can find more information here: [ValhallaMC Discord](https://dc.valhallamc.io/)

## Features

- **Automatic Updates:** Valhalla Updater automates the process of checking for updates and applying them to your modpacks, saving you time and effort.
- **Backups before updating:** Files on the server are automatically backed up, so you can restore them manually after a failed update.
- **Advanced Comparator:** Two level comparison ensures that the changes you made to the server are intact, and if any of the custom files are overwritten, it will list them.
- **CurseForge and FeedTheBeast Support:** Whether you're using CurseForge or FeedTheBeast modpacks, Valhalla Updater has got you covered.
- **Modular Architecture:** The project is designed to be easily extensible, with plans to create adapters for various databases beyond the current support for MongoDB and Pterodactyl.
- **Discord Integration:** Interact with Valhalla Updater directly from Discord using intuitive commands.
- **Modular Schedulers:** Choose from a selection of modular schedulers to tailor the update process to your preferences.

    name: 'FTB Skies Expert', //name of the pack
    modpack_version: '1.8.1', //current human-readable version of the modpack
    serverId: 'asdadas', //server id on pterodactyl, last part of the url of the server console
    modpackID: 117, //id of the modpack on cf or ftb
